counter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wei2912/counter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wei2912/counter)
---

This project provides an efficient object frequency counter, based upon [Data.Map.Strict](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.5.6.3/docs/Data-Map-Strict.html). This library was inspired by [Python's collections.Counter](https://docs.python.org/dev/library/collections.html#collections.Counter).
